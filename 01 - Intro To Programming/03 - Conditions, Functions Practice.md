Revision:
What is a variable, constant, and function? Expression?

Calculate the fraction (4a + 5b) / (3a - 2b), when a = 1 and b = 2. (answer: -14)

  x2 - 3xy + 2y2 (where x and y are positive values)
  ______________
   sqrt(4x + 3y)

Calculate the value of the expression: 

Function: reusable chunk of code, that can take inputs and take an action or produce an output.
Variable: is a container for a value that can change
Constant: is a value that doesn't change
Expression: is a group of variables and constants connected by operators

- Expressions vs conditions
- Conditions are expressions that contain a logical operator
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
- Logical operators: || (OR), && (AND)
- Logical expressions return true or false
- Check the value of an expression using console.log(<expression>)

Examples of simple comparisons using >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

Exercise:
Function to return the bigger number of two given numbers:

function max(a, b) {
    if (a > b) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
}
